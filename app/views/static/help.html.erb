	Sectors on the wheel are marked on a scale of 1 - 10 to indicate how satisfied or dissatisfied you are with each area of your life, with 10 being the most satisfied and 1 being the least. Ideally you should aim for at least an 8 in most areas of your life.

<div class="help_text"> 
	Your wheel not only identifies where you are least satisfied but also emphasizes where you may be overexerting yourself, spending time and energy on activities that could possibly be more productively or rewardingly used elsewhere. With this in mind as you set goals for improvement it is not only important to identify the activities you plan to start doing in order to regain balance in your life but also to identify the activities you plan to either stop doing, re-prioritize or delegate to others.

	Although there may be several areas you may need to work on, it is advised that you work on no more than one or two areas at a time so that you might maintain focus and hereby increase your chance of success in those particular areas. Know that improving targeted areas in your life will have a domino effect that can automatically positively impact other areas so it is not always necessary to start out by tackling your most difficult subjects or areas.

	We also advise that you log-in to review your wheel and update progress at least once a week to ensure that you stay on track and keep your goals at the forefront of your mind.
